                          This node will be used to locate the template VM, which will
                          be used for cloning operations.


                          Cloning will be performed according to the configuration.
                          Setting the `Target` field will tell Proxmox to clone the
                          VM on that target node.


                          When Target is not set and the ProxmoxCluster contains
                          a set of `AllowedNodes`, the algorithm will instead evenly
                          distribute the VMs across the nodes from that list.


                          If neither a `Target` nor `AllowedNodes` was set, the VM
                          will be cloned onto the same node as SourceNode.
